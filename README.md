**Prerequisites**: A Kubernetes deployment and devops tools like kubectl and helm

After cloning the repository, there is 1 more step to do. 

```bash
cd ForecastOptimiser/helm

# 1.
helm install target-helm targetx-helm -n <your K8s namespace> #where <your K8s namespace> is created by kubectl create ns <your K8s namespace>

```

### Use the application to obtain forecasts 

After the containers are up and running:

 - Obtain the <IP> address of the entrypoint service (nginx-service) with kubectl get svc nginx-ingress -o yaml -n <your K8s namespace> | grep ip
 - access the application at: (http://<IP)
 - login to the admin dashboard at: (http://<IP)
     - Default credentials: `admin` / `targetx`
     - they can be found/changed inside pvapp/frontend/src/Home.tsx


>\* ðŸ’¡ Info: *To build all images from their source code, you need to run sh create-containers.sh.*

> \*\* ðŸ’¡ Info: *To train your models using your own data (this repo does not contain the files we used for training as they are proprietary) you should you need to add the raw data in folder powerData. You will need to modify the target-trainer.py according to your data format. Finally, uncomment lines 21 and 22 of the create-containers.sh script*
