>This is the implentation of the ForecastOptimiser for [TARGETX](https://target-x.eu) first Open Call. (C) Lamda Networks, www.lamdanetworks.io     
## âš™ Setup locally

**Prerequisites**: A Kubernetes deployment and devops tools like kubectl and helm

After cloning the repository, there is 1 more step to do. 

```bash
cd ForecastOptimiser/helm

# 1.
helm install target-helm targetx-helm -n <your K8s namespace> #where <your K8s namespace> is created by kubectl create ns <your K8s namespace>

```

### Use the application to obtain forecasts 

After the containers are up and running:

 - Obtain the <IP> address of the entrypoint service (nginx-service) with kubectl get svc nginx-ingress -o yaml -n <your K8s namespace> | grep ip
 - access the application at: (http://<IP)
 - login to the admin dashboard at: (http://<IP)
     - Default credentials: `admin` / `targetx`
     - they can be found/changed inside your `.env` file SOS


>\* ðŸ’¡ Info: *To build all images from their source, you need to run sh create-containers.sh.*

> \*\* ðŸ’¡ Info: *The shell script used at step 4 (for adding test data) uses `jq` which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can install it with `apt install jq`*
